TileLoader project

A small Adobe AIR application used to upload images to web site using simple HTTP protocol.
Photos are being resized and rotated according to EXIF data client-side according to server-set strategy.

- PixelBender is used to resize images making resize fast and not freezing UI.
- ExifInfo library is used to get EXIF data: http://code.shichiseki.jp/as3/ExifInfo/
- Alchemy asynchronous JPEG encoder is used to encode JPG: http://segfaultlabs.com/devlogs/alchemy-asynchronous-jpeg-encoding-2

Application is built using Parsley 2.4 Framework: http://www.spicefactory.org/parsley/

The parent project for the application was terminated so it is not a release!
Although but is a fully functioning version...
